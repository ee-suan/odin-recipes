<h2>Description</h2>
<p>You will love how easy this is to make! Walking in to the kitchen to throw a few ingredients together, only to come out with a warm creamy bowl of comforting soup in minutes. A warm bowl of soup so deliciously creamy with tender bites of mushroom pieces. Full flavoured with garlic, onions and herbs subtle enough to shine through and compliment the natural flavour of mushrooms without overpowering it. Cooked with easy to find ingredients you may already have in your kitchen, you are minutes away from a satisfying bowl of creamy goodness!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mushrooms: Fresh brown or cremini mushrooms are perfect for this recipe. You could also use mini portobello mushrooms, or a combination of your favourite mushroom varieties.</li>
    <li>Herbs: The best herbs we have found over the years to compliment those incredible flavours is a combination of thyme and parsley. Of course, if you don’t like those, you can also use rosemary, oregano, tarragon, chives or cilantro. Use what you love!</li>
    <li>Cream: Half and half, heavy cream, light cream or thickened cream all yield similar results, however heavy cream adds richness.</li>
    <li>Flour: We need flour to create that delicious, creamy texture mushroom soup is loved for. You can leave it out and use cornstarch if you wish. I recommend 2-3 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 1/4 cup water (slurry). If unsure about quantities for your liking, add the cornstarch slurry in tablespoon increments, stirring in between, until you’ve achieved your ideal texture.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat butter and oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until melted. Sauté onion for 2 to 3 minutes until softened. Cook garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add mushrooms and 2 teaspoons thyme, cook for 5 minutes. Pour in wine and allow to cook for 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle mushrooms with flour, mix well and cook for 2 minutes. Add stock, mix again and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low-medium heat, season with salt, pepper and crumbled bouillon cubes.</li>
    <li>Cover and allow to simmer for 10-15 minutes, while occasionally stirring, until thickened.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low, stir in cream or half and half. Allow to gently simmer (do not boil). Adjust salt and pepper to your taste.</li>
    <li>Mix in parsley and remaining thyme. Serve warm.</li>
</ol>
